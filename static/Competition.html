                <h2>COMPETITION</h2>
                <p>The Photographic Angle regularly runs photographic competitions which are open
                    and accessible to everyone, regardless of their location, ability, experience,
                    equipment or age.</p>
                <p>Each competition has a theme, chosen by our Head of Design, and we welcome
                    submissions that illustrate this theme showcasing originality and a unique
                    viewpoint. The competitions are free to enter and TPA enlists the help of an
                    independent judge who is given the responsibility of selecting the winning
                    entries. One photographer whose entry is deemed the best representation of the
                    competition theme will be awarded a prize.</p>
                <p>Throughout the year, our Head of Design will also choose a selection of the best
                    entries submitted to various competition themes for inclusion in one of our
                    future photographic exhibitions. The chosen images will then be printed by the
                    charity and exhibited at no expense to the photographers. If your work is chosen
                    for inclusion you will be contacted via email and asked to send us high resolution
                    versions of your work.</p>

                <p>Our Folklore competition has now closed for entries and the results will be posted
                    here soon!</p>
                <p>The new theme ‘Expression’ will open for entries shortly, so why not start thinking
                    about great ways to inspire us with your imagery.</p>
